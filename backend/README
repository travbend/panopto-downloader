[TO BUILD + RUN]
 - Copy the backend/docs/reference_config/env_config to backend/env_config
 - Modify the relevant environment variables in the backend/env_config/.env file (particularly hostname and ports if needed)
 - Add postgres_password.txt, rabbitmq_password.txt, and redis_password.txt files to backend/env_config directory and 
   set the environment variables for the usernames in .env file if needed
 - Add acme.json file (for traefik) to backend/env_config directory
    - Create a blank acme.json file on host machine and set the ACME_FILE_PATH env var
    - Run "chmod 600 acme.json" to set permissions (if on windows, run this in the docker terminal in the traefik container)
 - To build the project, run the below command ()
      docker compose --env-file "env_config/.env" -f compose.yaml -f compose.dev.yaml -p panopto-downloader build
 - To run the project, run the below command (add "-d" after "up" to run detached)
      docker compose --env-file "env_config/.env" -f compose.yaml -f compose.dev.yaml -p panopto-downloader up
 - To stop the running project when detached, run
      docker compose --env-file "env_config/.env" -f compose.yaml -f compose.dev.yaml -p panopto-downloader stop
 - For production build/run, use the compose.prod.yaml instead of compose.dev.yaml in the above commands
NOTE: Traefik depends on the project name being panopto-downloader for networks to work (based on environment variable 
    and -p flag)

[DATABASE MIGRATIONS]
 - Install python requirements locally (e.g., alembic, sqlalchemy)
 - Add .../backend/src/ to PYTHONPATH env var on dev machine
 - Add SQLALCHEMY_CONNECTION_STRING env var on dev machine (change hostname to localhost or hostname)
 - Close and reopen vscode after editing system environment variables
 - Make sure the database container is running
 - cd to backend/src/common/data/sqlalchemy (i.e., location of alembic.ini)
 - Run "alembic revision -m "commit message" --autogenerate" replacing with the proper commit message
 - Edit autogenerated migration script in alembic/versions as needed
 - Remove sqlalchemy environment variable from dev machine so that it does not overwrite the .env file 
    (TODO: make this better process)

[DEBUGGING]
 - To debug, using the sample config in .vscode/launch.json to attach to the container process. 
   By default, the API uses port 5678 and the worker uses port 5679 (can be changed in compose.yaml)
   Note that the worker has a debug connection opened for each thread

[TODO]
 - Add better logging / metrics to API. Notifications?
