[TO BUILD + RUN]
docker compose build
docker compose -p panopto-downloader up
NOTE: Traefik depends on the project name being panopto-downloader for networks to work (based on environment variable)

[DATABASE MIGRATIONS]
Install python requirements locally (e.g., alembic, sqlalchemy)
Add .../backend/src/ to PYTHONPATH env var on dev machine
Add SQLALCHEMY_CONNECTION_STRING env var on dev machine (change hostname to localhost or hostname)
Close and reopen vscode after editing system environment variables
Make sure the database container is running
cd to backend/src/common/data/sqlalchemy (i.e., location of alembic.ini)
Run "alembic revision -m "commit message" --autogenerate" replacing with the proper commit message
Edit autogenerated migration script in alembic/versions as needed
Remove sqlalchemy environment variable from dev machine so that it does not overwrite the .env file (TODO: fix?)

[TODO]
 - Add better logging / metrics to API. Notifications?
 - Traefik Let's Encrypt
 - Domain name? Subdomain?
